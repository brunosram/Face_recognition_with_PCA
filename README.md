# Face_recognition_with_PCA

## Dataset

The dataset I'm using is ORL faces from Olivetti Research Laboratory. It is composed of 400 images of size 112 × 92, in 8-bit unsigned integer. That’s 10304 pixels in total. There are 40 identities, each identity has 10 images, taken at diﬀerent lighting, facial expressions and time. Here I just used first 10 personalities to finish my experiment
